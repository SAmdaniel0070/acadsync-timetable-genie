- **CSV**: Comma-separated values with UTF-8 encoding
- **PDF**: Tabular data (basic extraction)
- **Headers**: First row must contain column headers
- **Size Limit**: Maximum 10MB per file

### **Data Quality Tips:**
1. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions
2. **No Special Characters**: Avoid special characters in names
3. **Time Format**: Use 24-hour format (HH:MM)
4. **Boolean Values**: Use "Yes/No" or "True/False"
5. **Email Uniqueness**: Ensure teacher emails are unique
6. **Code Uniqueness**: Ensure subject codes are unique

### **Upload Order:**
1. **Classes** (creates years automatically)
2. **Subjects** (with class assignments)
3. **Teachers** (with subject assignments)
4. **Classrooms**
5. **Timings**
6. **Generate Timetable**
