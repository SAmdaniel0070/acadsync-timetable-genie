# Manual Edit Mode Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing timetable_id in lesson updates
**Problem**: When updating lessons in manual edit mode, the `timetable_id` field was not being preserved, causing lessons to lose their association with the timetable.

**Fix**: 
- Updated `TimetableService.updateLesson()` to preserve the `timetable_id` field
- Modified the Timetables page handlers to ensure `timetable_id` is always passed
- Updated TimetableEditDialog to receive and use the timetable object

### 2. Inconsistent field mapping between database and frontend
**Problem**: The application used both snake_case (database) and camelCase (frontend) field names inconsistently, causing data synchronization issues.

**Fix**:
- Ensured both field formats are maintained for compatibility
- Updated service methods to handle both field naming conventions
- Added proper field transformation in all CRUD operations

### 3. Missing multi-slot lesson support
**Problem**: 2-hour lab lessons weren't being handled properly during manual edits, missing continuation slots and proper duration tracking.

**Fix**:
- Added support for `duration_slots`, `is_continuation`, and `parent_lesson_id` fields
- Updated `addLesson()` to automatically create continuation lessons for 2-hour labs
- Modified `deleteLesson()` to handle deletion of multi-slot lesson groups
- Enhanced TimetableEditDialog to detect and warn about 2-hour lab sessions

### 4. Real-time sync improvements
**Problem**: Changes made in manual edit mode weren't being reflected across all timetable views immediately.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced the useTimetableSync hook with better logging and error handling
- Added immediate local state updates for better UX before real-time sync
- Improved the refresh mechanism to ensure consistency

### 5. Save changes functionality
**Problem**: The "Save Changes" button wasn't properly persisting manual edits to the database.

**Fix**:
- Updated the `handleSaveChanges` function to properly save timetable state
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Added proper loading states during save operations

## Key Changes Made

### Service Layer (`src/services/timetableService.ts`)
- Enhanced `updateLesson()` to preserve all lesson fields including multi-slot properties
- Modified `addLesson()` to return the created lesson and handle 2-hour lab continuation
- Updated `deleteLesson()` to properly handle multi-slot lesson deletion
- Improved field mapping consistency throughout all methods

### Components (`src/components/timetable/`)
- Updated `TimetableEditDialog` to receive timetable object and handle multi-slot lessons
- Enhanced `TimetableView` to pass timetable context to edit dialog
- Improved error handling and user feedback in edit operations

### Pages (`src/pages/Timetables.tsx`)
- Enhanced lesson CRUD handlers to ensure proper timetable_id association
- Added immediate local state updates for better UX
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### Hooks (`src/hooks/useTimetableSync.ts`)
- Added better logging for debugging real-time sync issues
- Enhanced error handling in sync operations
- Improved refresh mechanism reliability

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Manual Edit Mode Testing**:
   - Enable edit mode and try adding/editing/deleting lessons
   - Verify changes are saved and reflected across all timetable views
   - Test with both regular lessons and 2-hour lab sessions

2. **Multi-Slot Lesson Testing**:
   - Add a 2-hour lab lesson and verify continuation slot is created
   - Edit a 2-hour lab lesson and ensure both slots are updated
   - Delete a 2-hour lab lesson and verify both slots are removed

3. **Real-time Sync Testing**:
   - Make changes in one browser tab/window
   - Verify changes appear in other tabs/windows
   - Test the refresh functionality

4. **Cross-View Consistency**:
   - Make changes in master view and verify they appear in teacher/class/classroom views
   - Test filtering and view switching after making edits

## Usage Instructions

1. **Enable Edit Mode**: Click the "Edit Mode" toggle in the timetable actions
2. **Add Lessons**: Click the "+" button in empty time slots
3. **Edit Lessons**: Click the edit icon that appears on hover over existing lessons
4. **Delete Lessons**: Use the delete button in the edit dialog
5. **Save Changes**: Click "Save Changes" to persist all modifications
6. **Real-time Sync**: Changes are automatically synchronized across all views

The manual edit mode now properly saves changes and reflects them across all timetable views with full support for multi-slot lessons and real-time synchronization.
